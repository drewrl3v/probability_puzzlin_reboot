# Geometric Probability

## Puzzle Style Geometry Problems

1. We draw two chords at random on a unit circle.
What is the probability that the chords intersect?

2. We take three samples uniformly from the interval $[0,1]$
and denote them $A$, $B$, and $C$. What is the probability that 
$A < B < C$?

3. We draw three points uniformly at random on the circumerence of 
the unit circle, what's the probability that all three points belong 
to the same semi-circle?

4. You are given a unit disk. Three poles are then stabbed perpendicularly 
into the unit disk, forming a table. What's the probability if we turn the 
table over it will stand up right without falling over?

## Classical Geometric Probability Results

1. (Buffon's Needle): We have parallel lines that are separated $1$-unit away 
from each other and they span the entire plane. We toss a needle a length $1$ 
onto the plane, what is the probability that the needle crosses a line?
