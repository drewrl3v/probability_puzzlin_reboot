    Note these style of puzzles require that you "see" something that hints how to solve the puzzle.
    below are puzzles of increasing difficulty. You don't need to solve them, but I want to test 
    your ability to "see" hidden messages in the puzzles.

    (NOTE-ANDREW: Just try and see if you can start the puzzle and find some hidden clue, message, or instruction in the image.)

    The Jane Street Puzzle Master has twenty-three errands (don't worry, almost all of them are tiny!) that she needs to cross off her to-do list (above) on her day off. 
    If she can manage that small task, she plans to meet up with some friends tonight for a short while. Can you figure out where they'll meet up, and why?

    (NOTE-ANDREW: Again, you don't need to solve the entire puzzle. Just see if you can "see" a hidden clue, message, or instruction in the image.)
